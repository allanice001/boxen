# BoXenLinux&reg;
An Ubuntu based Linux&reg; distribution for Nonprofits.

It is best described as a collection of open source projects. Configured and extended for Nonprofits. e.g. [Ubuntu], [LTSP], [FreeRDP], and many others! It comes in both server (boxenbrain) and client (boxenbaby) variations. Boxenbrain is all you need if you have a wired network, your clients will boot from the network. However, if you need wireless clients, or remote VPN clients you'll need to use boxenbaby with them. 

BoxenLinux excels at providing thin and zero client driven remote desktop sessions. Linux, Windows, Android and MacOS using ldm, xfreerdp, and xtightvncviwer respectively. It can also provide fatclients for Ubuntu Desktop. [KVM-VDI] provides VDI based remote desktop for all OS's using KVM and Spice. It uses GlusterFS for clustered storage and CTDB for shares. Epoptes provides management and live interaction with all clients.

Ubuntu and LTSP can provide a platform for providing desktops environments in many different ways.

LTSP already comes with these client scripts:
```sh
kiosk â€“ Firefox running locally on thin client.
ldm â€“ Linux desktop running remotely on local server.
menu â€“ Interactive Menu
shell â€“ Drop to root bash shell running locally on thin client.
ssh â€“ Secure Shell for remote terminal on local or remote server.
telnet â€“ unsecure ssh ðŸ˜‰ running remotely on local or remote server.
xdmcp â€“ Raw Xorg linux desktop running remotely on server.
xfreerdp â€“ RDP for Windows desktop running remotely on local or cloud server.
xterm â€“ xterm terminal running locally on thin client.
```
This has been furthered by my BoXen Linux project to include:
```sh
freerdp-nightly â€“ Nightly builds of xfreerdp to take advantage of Microphone redirection and the latest graphics codecs.
rdpgui â€“ Gui for displaying a welcome website, and to prompt for credentials when using xfreerdp-nightly.
vdi â€“ KVM-VDI LTSP client, see github.com/Seitaâ€¦
vnc â€“ VNCviewer for remote desktop on local or remote Android or MacOS computers.
spice â€“ virt-viewer for KVM Virtualization software. Can provide remote access to local or remote desktops of ANY kind you can virtualize.
x2go - Linux remote desktop for local or remote servers. 
welcome - Gui Welcome window to display a welcome URL using zenity
```

Once can initiate the below commands in a terminal to copy the config files from this repository to keep updated:
Not working
```sh
cd /
sudo apt install git
sudo git init
sudo git remote add origin https://github.com/jphein/boxen
sudo pull origin master
sudo chmod +x /usr/share/ltsp/screen.d/*
sudo ltsp-update-image -c /
```

To install on the second server or for a headless install, PXE boot using existing boXen or LTSP server: 

```sh
#Add to MAC of second server your existing dhcp conf to tell it to run the installer by default when it PXE boots
[<mac address>]
 filename /ubuntu-installer/amd64/pxelinux.0

#Log in remotely into second server, after install
ssh ubuntu@<ip from dhcp syslog> -p ubuntu 
```
Then run the above steps as if you were installing with CD
